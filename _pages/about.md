Danqing Huang obtained her B.S degree from Sun Yat-sen University, China in 2014. Then she received her Ph.D in a joint program of Sun-Yat-sen University and Microsoft Research Asia, advised by Prof. Jian Yin and Dr. Chin-Yew Lin. She is now a Senior Researcher at Microsoft. Her research interests include natural language processing (e.g., question answering, semantic parsing) and artificial intelligence applications for graphic design.
